Start with a list of items then iterate over them to compute a single value.it works just like basic arithmetic
Lets consider  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 <br>
We have here a list of numbers they will reduce to a single value using a function called addition
The result of the 1st 2 element will add to the next one like <br>
1+2 +3 +4 <br>
3+3+4 <br>
6+4 <br>
10 <br>
Ans-10 <br>
This is actually a loop with a memory
It does this by applying a reducer function to each element in that array
The result is the combine total of the array
